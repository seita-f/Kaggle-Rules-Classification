# Reddit Comment Rules Classification
This is the log for the Kaggle competiton [Jigsaw - Agile Community Rules Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-agile-community-rules) <br>
The task is to create a model that predicts whether Reddit comments violate specific rules. The labels for the training data are binary (violated or not violated), but during test inference, the model must output a numerical probability indicating the likelihood of violation.
Furthermore, the test data contains a large amount of data that includes rules not present in the training data.
